# D8-proj
Collection of Drupal 8 projects

# Description
-This repo is meant for private use short-term, but it will probably become more publicly angled later.  
-The idea is to use the repo to back up projects in development so it's easy to get back to a working state if something goes wrong or if modifications are made that turns out to be less than ideal.  
-It is assumed that tracking the modules and sites folders in addition to a folder for database dumps is sufficient. This will probably be tested soon.  
-The projects are created in Acquia DevDesktop. To be able to run them, install this and clone the repo to the Folder that DevDesktop uses for new projects. More configuration might be needed.  
-The plan is to ignore all files in the repo except the projects that need tracking.
